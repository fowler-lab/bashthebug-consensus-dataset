## purpose

This repository contains the raw data tables used in the below scientific preprint that is currently under review at a journal. Its aim is to ensure that the results can be reproduced by other people and therefore a Jupyter notebook is included that allows one to recreate nearly all the figures and tables in the manuscript from the raw data tables.

> *BashTheBug: a crowd of volunteers reproducibly and accurately measure the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 13 antitubercular drugs from photographs of 96-well broth microdilution plates*
